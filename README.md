# AdventOfCode
This is my repo for AdventOfCode based off my python [ML template repo](https://github.com/Philliams/ml_template).

The intent of the code is to explore and refine python best practices. Notable, the following concepts are explored in this repo are:
* Property-Based testing using `Hypothesis` library (see `./unittests` directory for test code.)
* Auto-generated documentation from docstrings using `Sphinx`.
* CD/CI using `github actions` (see `.github/workflows` directory for build pipeline)

Auto-generated documentation is available [here](https://philliams.github.io/AdventOfCode/).
